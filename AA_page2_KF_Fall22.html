                            The risk of having your content shared outside your trusted network is just too high for social media to ever offer a reliable sense of privacy for users.
                            <br>
                            <strong> Address the expectation of privacy</strong> 
                        </p>

                <section class = "group"> 
                    <h3>
                        Responsibility

                    <p> 
                        Reaching any level of privacy comes down to the user being responsible with what they share.

                    <p>
                        Features like privating your account provide false security for users. While these post's can't be shared, however users take a screenshot.
